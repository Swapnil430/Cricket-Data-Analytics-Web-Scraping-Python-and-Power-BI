# Cricket Data Analytics- Web Scraping, Python and Power BI

#Problem Statement#
Allens have challenged us to a cricket match. We need to form a team of 11 players to compete against them.

We have used cricket T20 world cup (2022) data to build insights on a best 11 players team that we can assemble from the earth that can go and play with aliens. We used Bright Data web scraping to collect data from espncricinfo website then we performed some data transformation and cleaning in Pandas, followed by building dashboards in power bi.
